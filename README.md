# OLDungeon
Only for real elders who really want to experience old AI Dungeon. Thadunge2 fork with small additions. Get model from thadunge and put it in models folder inside generator/gpt2 to make it work.

# Features
* World Info taken from up-to-date AI Dungeon, see WI Manager for creation of world info
* Prompt browsing 
* Variables in prompts
* Author's note

# Features in work
* Translation with googletrans library
* Colorama for better UI

# Installation
1. Do `pip -r requirements.txt` in game folder
2. Download the model_v5 through torrent: https://github.com/AIDungeon/AIDungeon/files/3935881/model_v5.torrent.zip
3. Put model_v5 folder after it's downloaded to /generator/gpt2/models
4. Run play.py

I'm not sure if this will work for anyone or not, I've created this fork just for my needs.
