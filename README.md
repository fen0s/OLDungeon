# OLDungeon
Only for real elders who really want to experience old AI Dungeon experience. Thadunge2 fork with small additions. Get model from thadunge and put it in models folder inside generator/gpt2 to make it work.

# Features
* World Info taken from up-to-date AI Dungeon, see WI Manager for creation of world info
* Prompt browsing 
* Variables in prompts

# Features in work
* Translation with googletrans library
* Colorama for better UI

I'm not sure if this will work for anyone or not, I've created this fork just for my needs.
